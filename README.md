# About Me

<p style="text-align: justify!important">I am Armin, a 25-year-old software engineer with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. My journey into software development began in 2018 when I was introduced to software development frameworks and principles at Spark Academy in Maglaj. Since then, I have cultivated a strong foundation in software engineering, enhanced by completing a 4-year education at the Faculty of Information Technologies (FIT) in Mostar from 2019 to 2023, where I engaged with numerous esteemed faculty members and even received job offers during my studies. One of my key academic highlights includes securing stipends from a U.S.-based company, where I collaborated with other IT professionals and professors in AI research and software development. Concurrently, I gained hands-on industry experience as a full-time software developer at Evona and a part-time consultant/software engineer at ArtiAnalytics (later on full-time employment), where I worked on diverse projects.</p>
